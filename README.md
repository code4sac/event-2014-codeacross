=====================

This is a github page to which we can all contribute. github is the host, and code is on branch = gh-pages. 

In the final weeks leading up to CodeAcross, Code for America is pushing out lots of information. 

C4S has not tried this github feature out yet... but let's see if it can help us collaborate and stay organized. 

**Notes:** 

*all contributors welcome! 

*for ideas, questions, etc. let's see if we can make use of this repo's issues feature... if not... well, google groups it is then ;-)

that's all for now!
