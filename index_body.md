What is CodeAcross?
--------------------

CodeAcross 2014 is a weekend of events taking place in cities around the world on February 21-23, 2014. Coinciding with International Open Data Day, the goal of CodeAcross is to activate the Code for America network and inspire residents everywhere to get actively involved in their community.

On Saturday, February 22, folks from across the Sacramento Region will gather at Hacker Lab for a digital exploration of our communities. Everyone is welcome — Urbanists, Civic Hackers, Government Staff, Developers, Designers — anyone with passion for making their community better!

Agenda
